### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

### My name is Michael Torres.  I will soon be graduating from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas with a degree in Computer Science and a double minor in Biology and Mathematics.  After obtaining laboratory and research experience while pursuing a degree in Biochemistry, I decided to focus my interests towards data analytics.  I aim to gain more experience in the field of analytics before hopefully making a transition into a role as a data scientist.  Over the years I have constructed a collection of projects that encompass my experience and knowledge within the vast field of analytics and data science.  Here are some pieces of my work and scientific research that I hope highlight some of my qualities as a Data Analyst ðŸ™‚
