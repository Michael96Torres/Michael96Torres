### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

### My name is Michael Torres.  I am currently a computer science student at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.  After obtaining laboratory and research experience while working towards a degree in Biochemistry, I decided to switch majors and pursue my interests in data analytics.  I aim to gain more experience in the field of analytics before hopefully making a transition into a data scientist role.
